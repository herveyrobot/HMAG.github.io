## Deceptive Strategy Generation for Air-Ground Swarm Competition

## <center> Abstract <center>
We aim to gain insight into the blind spots of reinforcement learning (RL) deceptive adversarial attacks and defenses in heterogeneous multi-robot air-ground swarm confrontation. RL policy observations are known to be susceptible to adversarial perturbations, but it is difficult to modify the adversary's observations in natural environment combat directly. So this raises the question, is it possible to interfere with the battle's outcome through deceptive behavior? This paper develops a simulation environment for heterogeneous multi-robot air-ground combat, demonstrating a zero-sum game by observing the opponent's behavior. We propose a dynamic balance adversarial technique that effectively increases the behavioral diversity of swarm models in dynamic environments, such as a pincer attack, evasion, and flanking, thereby improving adversarial defense capabilities. A deceptive black-box attack is performed against the trained airpower RL model. The results show that this behavioral attack effectively reduces the number of winning rounds of the victim strategy.
