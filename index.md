## Multi-robot Air-to-Ground Adersarial Policies

## Abstract
We aim to gain insight into the blind spots of deep learning models in multi-robot air-to-ground swarm confrontation. Existing work mainly focuses on the research of static scenes and single robots, and the blind spot problem of multi-robot confrontation in dynamic scenes is not very clear. In this study, we developed a simulated environment for multi-robot air-to-ground combat. Through different swarm behavioral confrontation, a time-varying adversarial balancing method is proposed, which effectively improves the swarm model’s robustness against competition and behavioral diversity in dynamic environments. Through a large number of experiments, the advantages and disadvantages of individual decision-making and centralized decision-making in this group operation are explored. In particular, we further combine the objective fact that it is difficult to directly attack the local model in the natural environment, and propose a behavioral deception attack strategy, which uses the change of the robot’s own motion trajectory to achieve the attack on the guardian model.
